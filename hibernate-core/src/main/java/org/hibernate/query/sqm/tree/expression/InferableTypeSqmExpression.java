/**
 * Extension for SqmExpression implementations whose type can be inferred from
 * their surroundings.  E.g., consider an HQL fragment like
 * `... where e.status = :status...` where `e.status` is reference to a mapped
 * enumerated attribute.  The parameter would have no associated type, but its
 * usage in a comparison with `e.status` implies that the parameter type ought
 * to be the same as that `status` attribute.  This is used to handle cases where
 * we ought to apply value conversions based on this implied type.  E.g., in this
 * example, assuming `status` is an `Enumerated` attribute, we would need to apply
 * the same value conversion (named/ordinal) for the parameter as we would for
 * `status`.
 *
 * @implNote This is mandated by JPA in certain usage contexts (surroundings).
 * Hibernate supports a far greater set of usage contexts.
 *
 * todo (6.0) : document these various contexts ^^
