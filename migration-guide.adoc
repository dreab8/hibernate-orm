= 6.0 Migration Guide
:toc:

This guide discusses migration from Hibernate ORM version 5.2 to version 6.0.  For migration from
earlier versions, see any other pertinent migration guides as well.

== Background

6.0 introduces major changes, such as:

* refactoring Hibernate's Type contract to unify Hibernate ORM, JPA and SQM type systems
* migration to SQM for query interpretation/representation
** HQL/JPQL
** (JPA) criteria queries

Additionally, `hibernate-envers` has been made part of `hibernate-core` and better integrated
from an API perspective.

== Misc

* removed `org.hibernate.type.TypeHelper` and `org.hibernate.type.TypeResolver`, as well as methods exposing
access to them.  For the most part, replace with calls to `org.hibernate.Metamodel`
and/or `org.hibernate.type.spi.TypeConfiguration`.
* removed `org.hibernate.type.TypeFactory` in favor of `TypeConfiguration`
